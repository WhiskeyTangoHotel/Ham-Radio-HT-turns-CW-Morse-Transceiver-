Ham Radio HT turns CW (Morse) Transceiver

There was talk between the CW operators at the club to have some CW practice sessions or a CW Net on 2M FM.  
We will probable never do that (for several reasons) but the idea of converting a ham radio HT into 
a CW transceiver was an interesting thought project.
